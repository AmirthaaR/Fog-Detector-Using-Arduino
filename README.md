# Fog-Detector-Using-Arduino
Arduino-based Fog Detection and Alert System using Potentiometer, LEDs, and Buzzer.

### 🔍 Overview
This project detects fog intensity using a potentiometer (simulated as an LDR) and automatically adjusts headlights while alerting the driver with a buzzer.

### ⚙️ Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- Potentiometer (as fog sensor)  
- 2 LEDs (Low Beam & High Beam)  
- Buzzer  
- Resistors (220Ω)  
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires  

### 💡 Working Principle
- Bright → LEDs OFF  
- Fog → Green LED (Low Beam) ON  
- Heavy Fog → Red LED (High Beam) + Buzzer ON  

### 🧠 Tools Used
- Arduino IDE  
- Tinkercad Circuits (Simulation)  

### 🚀 Future Scope
Can be extended with real fog sensors, IoT connectivity, and adaptive vehicle systems.
